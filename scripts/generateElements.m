function positions = generateElements(xElements, yElements, pitch)
    % Generates positions for element transducer probe estimation
    % Returns a matrix of positions, corresponding to their physical
    % distance relative to the origin where the origin is in the direct
    % centre of the transducer. Only relies on the pitch between the
    % elements as we assume the position is the centre of the element. 
    arguments 
        xElements double % Number of elements on horizontal side of transducer
        yElements double % Number of elements on vertical side of transducer
        pitch double     % Pitch between the elements of the transducer
